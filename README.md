# Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project

Project code for Udacity's Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program. In this project, a neural network is developd for an image classifier built with TensorFlow.

### Data
Training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on.  

## predictor
The trained classifier will be used to build a terminal program that takes an image and print the prediction of it
